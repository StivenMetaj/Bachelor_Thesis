# Bio-inspired Network Forming Protocols Design Applied to Vehicular Fog Computing - Bachelor Thesis
This repository contains the pdf file and the presentation of my bachelor thesis about Vehicular Fog Computing. In particular the thesis is about the design of a protocol that would permit to form networks between vehicles. 

The peculiarity of the study is the nature of the protocol, inspired indeed by the bacteria communities formation properties (for this reason "bio-inspired"). This network forming is not only interesting from the Fog Computing point of view, but also from the graph topologies perspective; indeed, the results seem in line with "Small-World" graphs studies and properties. 

Check the presentation to have a fast overview of the topic and a easy understanding of the thesis work and results! To have instead more information on how I obtained the results presented read the Thesis.

Note that all the material is in Italian... no english versione was made at that time, sorry about it.

Note also that no code is included in the repository. You can find some code snippet inside the thesis itself, but the entire project is not open-source and so the complete code can't be inserted.
